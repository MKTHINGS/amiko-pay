<h1>Amiko Pay</h1>
<p>
A scalable, de-centralized network for fast, secure, cheap and privacy-friendly
off-blockchain Bitcoin transactions.
</p>
<hr>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-6">

<h2>Scalable</h2>
Amiko Pay is scalable to billions of users, without losing its desirable
properties. Potentially, all people could use Amiko Pay for all their
daily transactions.
<p>
<div id="details-scalable" class="collapse">
Combining scalability and de-centralization is hard. Centralized systems,
such as credit card networks, are easy to scale, but even these currently
only serve a small portion of the world population. Bitcoin is
de-centralized, but its de-centralized nature depends on all (or many)
participants exchanging all transactions with each other. When scaling
such a system to larger numbers of transactions, it becomes less
attractive for participants to participate in this process, leaving the
transaction processing to a small, relatively centralized group of
organizations.
<p>
Amiko Pay solves this problem by leaving most transactions out of the
block chain. Transaction information is normally only exchanged between a few
participants, and participants can forget about the transaction as soon as it
is completed. The block chain is only used for changes to the network (opening
and closing micro-transaction channels), and for enforcement of transaction
states and channel balances in case a participant is not playing by the rules.
Both should be very rare compared to the frequency of regular transactions,
so the block chain can remain much smaller, and much easier to share.
</div>

</button>

<h2>De-centralized</h2>
Amiko Pay contains no dependencies on centralized parties, a.k.a. "single points
of control" / "single points of failure". All participants in the network can
potentially perform the same roles. The design of Amiko Pay contains features
that ensure it stays that way.
<p>
<div id="details-decentralized" class="collapse">
Amiko Pay participants create connections between each other, and transactions
are routed over these connections, similar to how information is routed over
the internet. The shape of the network is arbitrary, but just like the internet,
the network could become partially centralized around a couple of large service
providers. Unlike the internet, where creation of new physical connections is
expensive and difficult, connections in Amiko Pay are completely virtual, and
it will continue to be easy to create new connections. Also, routing in Amiko
Pay is designed such that intermediate parties can not determine the identity
of end points (payer and payee): it will always be possible to route transactions
through a proxy. This severely limits the power of any centralized entities,
and makes it possible to re-decentralize in case any centralized entity abuses
its position.

</button>

<h2>Fast</h2>
Amiko Pay transactions typically become definitive within seconds, often
even less than a second. This makes Amiko Pay suitable for Point Of Sale
(POS) applications.
<p>
<div id="details-fast" class="collapse">
Unlike regular Bitcoin transactions, Amiko Pay transactions are normally
<em>not</em> included in a block chain. Instead, they consist of updates
in the balances of micro-transaction channels, which are enforceable on
the block chain. Enforceability of a channel update is immediately clear,
so it does not have the issue of "zero confirmation double spending" of
regular Bitcoin transactions.
</div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-fast">
	Details
</button>

<h2>Secure</h2>
Other participants in the Amiko Pay network can not steal or freeze your funds.
<p>
<div id="details-secure" class="collapse">
By default, Amiko Pay is based on the same technology as the Lightning network.
This technology ensures that transactions and balances are always enforceable.
The idea is that, under normal operation, microtransaction channel balances are
updated cooperatively by the participants of a transaction. In case one of the
participants does not play by the rules, or becomes unresponsive, the
micro-transaction channels to that party will be closed by his neighbors in the
network, and the state of those channels will be enforced on the block chain
with Bitcoin smart contracts.
<p>
As an analogy, you can see a microtransaction channel as a "contract" between
two parties, and the block chain as a de-centralized "judge" (or jury). Most
contracts are followed voluntarily, and do not end up in court. However,
contracts still have power, since they are enforceable in court, even when they
do not always need to be enforced.
</div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-secure">
	Details
</button>

<h2>Cheap</h2>
Amiko Pay transactions are expected to be much cheaper than regular Bitcoin
transactions, making them potentially one of the cheapest payment methods
available. Amiko Pay is useful for true microtransactions, e.g. for
pay-per-article funding of websites, as an alternative to advertising.
<p>
<div id="details-cheap" class="collapse">
Intermediate nodes in the network are expected to charge some fees when
forwarding transactions, but since the cost of performing Amiko Pay transactions
is much lower than the total cost of keeping the same transactions in a block
chain, and since there will be plenty of competition between different parties,
the fees are expected to be much lower. Regular Bitcoin mining fees will still
be paid, but this will only happen infrequently (opening/closing of channels,
including conflict resolution).
<p>
Note that Amiko Pay is mostly useful for small transactions, where it is
essential to have low fees. For large transactions, Amiko Pay is less suitable,
since its microtransaction channels have a limited capacity (depending on
how many funds people put into them). For large transactions, regular
on-blockchain transactions remain more useful.
</div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-cheap">
	Details
</button>

<h2>Privacy-friendly</h2>
The existence of a transaction is only revealed to a couple of intermediate
parties, and these intermediate parties receive very little meta-data (basically
only the amount transferred and the moment the transaction is performed). There
is no need for intermediate parties to remember a transaction after it has
finished. The shape of the network (who is connected to who) is not completely
revealed.
<p>
<div id="details-privacy" class="collapse">
The privacy features are strongly related to how transaction routing is
performed. Amiko Pay uses a combination of non-source routing (where
intermediate nodes decide the direction of the route, based on a "destination
address") and "onion routing" (where the end points decide what route must be
followed, and where each next step in the route is encrypted, so that
previous nodes in the route can not read it). Amiko Pay uses bi-directional
routing, where both endpoints (payer and payee) route towards a meeting point.
The meeting point might be, but is not necessarily, the same node as one of the
end points (in case it is one of the end points, routing will of course be
unidirectional).
<p>
As a result of this, there is no need for payer/payee to reveal their network
addresses to each other or to other nodes, or to even <em>have</em> network
addresses. Payer and payee need to agree on the address of the "meeting point"
to be used; the "meeting point" node does not need to know the identity of
payer/payee. All that intermediate nodes see is the address of the next
onion-routing hop (the last of which is the meeting point), and the interface
on which the transaction was received. Because of the non-source routing
in-between onion-routing hops, nodes do not need a very detailed map of the
network to decide on an onion route. They only need to have a reasonable idea
of which nodes are reachable from which nodes through non-source routing.
<p>
There are some remaining privacy issues. Since the transaction time-out is
different on different hops of the route, it can be used to estimate the network
distance to the payee. This might be made less feasible by randomizing the
time-out increment. Another issue is that the software uses a certain hash value
for testing whether a transaction has committed or not; since this hash value is
the same on all hops, it can be used by an entity that has access to different
nodes on the network to see that the same transaction flows through both. While
this issue can be solved with certain technology, the combination of exact amount
and the moment the transaction occurred can still be used to correlate a
transaction on different parts of its route.

<h3>Why Bitcoin?</h3>
There is a long-term trend in society to replace cash with electronic
payment systems. The advantages are obvious: electronic money can be
better protected against robberies and it doesn't need costly and risky
physical transport.
<p>
However, the current methods of electronic payments depend on large,
centralized institutions like banks and credit card companies. This
dependency gives these entities a lot of power, allowing them to demand
customers and merchants to comply with rules that are not in the
interest of those customers and merchants. This is worsened by the fact
that those centralized institutions are easy targets for government
regulation, allowing the government to impose even more rules and
limitations. Also, because of differences and conflicts between
countries, regulations tend to be such that existing electronic payment
methods can not be provided in all countries simultaneously.
<p>
The reason why existing electronic payment systems depend on centralized
insititutions is a fundamental problem with electronic money:
digital information can be copied so easily. If a certain piece of information
represents a certain amount of money, then, by copying that information, the
money can be spent multiple times. Allowing this to happen would lead to
hyper-inflation; this is the essence of the "double spending" problem.
In traditional systems, this problem is avoided to some degree by letting some
central "trusted" regulator place limits on what people can do.
<p>
Bitcoin solves the double-spending problem without a central regulator by
de-centralizing the regulation: there is one public ledger (called the
"block chain"), and every Bitcoin participant can verify the correctness
of that ledger. There is a process called "mining", which is in essence
a de-centralized form of "voting", to reach consensus about which
transactions happened and which did not.
<p>
The result is that Bitcoin allows us to have the same freedom with electronic
payments as we have with cash.

<h3>Why off-blockchain transactions?</h3>
Bitcoin's "block chain" is a global ledger, which is shared among all
Bitcoin users. If all people in the world started to include all their
daily transactions into the block chain, then the block chain would
become so large that, at today's level of technology, almost no users
would choose to download, store and verify the entire block chain.
This would also increase the cost of setting up a miner.
<p>
While it is no problem if a part of Bitcoin users chooses not to verify
the block chain (for instance for use of low-capacity devices like smart
phones), it becomes a problem when the fraction of verifying users becomes
really small. If the large majority of economical power (merchants,
consumers) decides to trust a small group of miners on their word without
verifying the block chain, this puts a large amount of power in the
hands of that group of miners. This centralization of power undoes all
advantages offered by Bitcoin, so it has to be prevented.
<p>
If people choose to keep most of their transactions outside the block
chain, then the block chain can remain small and easily verifiable.
This allows Bitcoin to remain decentralized at the current level of
technology.
<p>
For the people who choose to perform transactions off-blockchain, there
can be immediate benefits as well: since "mining fees" are avoided,
off-blockchain transactions can be cheaper; since the slow de-centralized
consensus process of mining is avoided, transactions can be faster, and
since transactions are not entered in the publicly shared block chain,
privacy can be improved.

<h3>Why Amiko Pay?</h3>
Unlike some other off-blockchain solutions, Amiko Pay offers a solution
that is both secure and de-centralized; this way, all of the advantages
of using Bitcoin are preserved. Amiko Pay is designed to protect
privacy, and the privacy features also help keep the Amiko network open
for new participants.
<p>
Amiko Pay is completely open source, and provides an open platform, on
top of which other people can develop new innovative services.

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
Amiko Pay forms a network between users and payment providers, just like the
Internet forms a network between users and Internet providers. And,
just like the Internet, all providers deliver the same connectivity
(to websites vs. to merchants/customers), so large providers do not
have connectivity advantages over small providers.
<p>
Links between Amiko Pay nodes are protected by
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party" target="_blank">
micro-payment channels</a>; as a result, only a very low amount of trust
is required to securely establish a link with a payment provider.
This should remove the need for regulation, and it should allow people
to have a large choice of suitable payment providers; even a small,
unknown payment provider on a different continent can be a suitable
option. This should allow plenty of competition, leading to lots of
freedom and low prices.

page.

<h3>Where can I get it?</h3>
Amiko Pay is unfinished software, and since development is currently
not funded, the availability of development time is never guaranteed.
At the current pace of development, it might take a couple of years
before Amiko Pay becomes useful.
